Support specifying (not inferring):
  * table-name
  * model-name of an association
  * foreign-key-name

More callbacks.

"Serialization" of data structures as attribute values.

:stop-if-invalid to abort early inside (:validation ...) form.

Eager fetching of associations.

Test with hsqldb in addition to derby, different connections for different models. Will hopefully force:
  * eliminating vendor-specific bits.
  * getting db configuration saner.

(io!) bomb if any database work is attempted in a dosync block?
  * Gilardi has added this to sql/transaction.

Create lazy seqs for multi-value associations?
  Would like to do lazy singular associations too ... not sure what that can look like.

Generate fancier queries with some fancy query API.

Pretty migrations. Maybe just a series of contributions to clojure.contrib.sql.

Figure out a way to test init-model options without putting every bizarre case into manufacturer. It's getting ridiculous.
