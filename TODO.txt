Support specifying (not inferring):
  * table-name
  * model-name of an association
  * foreign-key-name

Callbacks.

(:stop-if-invalid) to abort early inside (:validation ...) form.

Eager fetching of associations.

Test with hsqldb in addition to derby, different connections for different models. Will hopefully force:
  * eliminating vendor-specific bits.
  * getting db configuration saner.

Allow a series of expressions to be executed on one connection, in one transaction.
  * Once that's done, get transactions wrapped around most tests.

(io!) bomb if any database work is attempted in a dosync block?

Create lazy seqs for multi-value associations?
  Would like to do lazy singular associations too ... not sure what that can look like.

Generate an IN clause when a seqable is given in the conditions map.

Pretty migrations. Maybe just a series of contributions to clojure.contrib.sql.
