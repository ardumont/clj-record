Figure out an API for associations.
  Maybe ...
    (has-many :products)
    (belongs-to :holding-company)
  creates
    (manufacturer/find-products {:id 3})
    (manufacturer/find-holding-company {:holding_company_id 3})

Create lazy seqs for multi-value associations?
  Would like to do lazy singular associations too ... not sure what that can look like.

Get db configuration sane.
