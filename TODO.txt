Create lazy seqs for multi-value associations?
  Would like to do lazy singular associations too ... not sure what that can look like.

Get db configuration saner.

Use prepared statements to get proper quoting.

Support for IN clause when a seq is given in the conditions map.

Eager fetching of associations.

Migrations.
