h1. clj-record

clj-record is a library inspired by Rails' ActiveRecord but implemented in the "Clojure programming language":http://www.clojure.org/ and intended to use its idioms.

This is a learning exercise and (at least for now) not intended for real-world use. Contributions to harden it are welcome, but I'm even more interested in recommendations for how to make it more idiomatically lisp-ey.

h2. The API

To define a model, you do something like this.

<pre><code>
  (ns com.example.user
    (:require clj-record.core))

  (clj-record.core/init-model)
</code></pre>

h3. Associations

Do this.

<pre><code>
  (ns ...)

  (clj-record.core/init-model
    (:associations
      (belongs-to account)
      (has-many subscriptions)))
</code></pre>

Then you can do things like this.

<pre><code>
  (let [mikey (user/find-record 2)
        subs (user/find-subscriptions mikey)]
    (doseq [subscription subs] (println (format "%s subscribed to %s" (:name mikey) (:name sub))))
    (user/destroy-subscriptions mikey)
    (println "But not any more."))
</code></pre>

h3. Validations

Do this.

<pre><code>
  (ns ...)

  (clj-record.core/init-model
    (:validation
      (:name "Longer please." #(> (count %) 3))))
</code></pre>

Then you get validation errors like this.

<pre><code>
  => (user/validate {:name "POO"})
  {:name ["Longer please."]}
</code></pre>

See "the tests":http://github.com/duelinmarkers/clj-record/tree/master/clj_record/test for everything that works.

h2. Running

Run clj_record/test/main.clj as a script to run tests. In addition to clojure-contrib, you'll need "Apache Derby":http://db.apache.org/derby/ on your classpath.

h2. The Name...

...is awful. Recommendations are welcome.
